/* 
 * This problem has you solve the classic "bounded buffer" problem with
 * multiple producers and multiple consumers:
 *
 *  ------------                         ------------
 *  | producer |-\                    /->| consumer |
 *  ------------ |                    |  ------------
 *               |                    |
 *  ------------ |                    |  ------------
 *  | producer | ----> bounded buffer -->| consumer |
 *  ------------ |                    |  ------------
 *               |                    |
 *  ------------ |                    |  ------------
 *  | producer |-/                    \->| consumer |
 *  ------------                         ------------
 *
 *  The program below includes everything but the implementation of the
 *  bounded buffer itself.  main() should do the following
 *
 *  1. starts N producers as per the first argument (default 1)
 *  2. starts N consumers as per the second argument (default 1)
 *
 *  The producer reads positive integers from standard input and passes those
 *  into the buffer.  The consumers read those integers and "perform a
 *  command" based on them (all they really do is sleep for some period...)
 *
 *  on EOF of stdin, the first producer passes N copies of -1 into the buffer.
 *  The consumers interpret -1 as a signal to exit.
